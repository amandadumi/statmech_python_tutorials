    "    * a collection of characters to be stored as text\n",
    "    * always expressed within quotes ('dog', 'three', '1.2')\n",
    "4. lists\n",
    "    * a set of other variable.\n",
    "    * represented within a set of square brakets\n",
    "    * can be ints (`[1,2,3,4]`), floats(`[1.2, 3.4, 7.0, .5]`), or strings ( `['dog', 'cat', 'snake']`)\n",
    "\n",
