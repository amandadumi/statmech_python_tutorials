# Install Python and Jupyter

## Installing Python through Anaconda
[Python](https://python.org/) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one installer Anaconda.

1. Navigate to the [download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for Anaconda.
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system. **Make sure you get the installer listed under Python 3** (not 2.7).
3. Double click the installer icon and follow the set-up instructions, keeping most of the default options. If you are Windows, make sure to choose to choose the option **Make Anaconda the default Python** during installation.

## Installing a Text Editor

You will need a text editor for this workshop. If you do not have a preferred text editor for writing code, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io). Download Atom at the link and install on your computer.

## Start a Jupyter notebook
From Finder or Spotlight (Mac OS) or the Start Menu (Windows) find the Anaconda Navigator.  The icon looks like a green circle.  Click Launch under Jupyter Notebook.  It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you haveever used the jupyter notebook, so don't panic if nothing loads for a few seconds.  Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. Use the file navigation window to navigate to `Desktop` and then to the `cms-workshop` folder.  In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list (shown below)

This will start a new Jupyter notebook using Python 3. You're ready to go!
