# Obtaining Materials
For our last session, we will be downloading materials from online. [Click here](https://github.com/amandadumi/statmech_python_tutorials/archive/master.zip) to download the directory as a `.zip` file. Unzip the repository. Navigate to `statmech_python_tutorials/materials/session03_math_io/`. Here you will find the jupyter notebook we will work from `session03_math_io.ipynb`. Launch Jupyter Notebook and work through the exercises.
